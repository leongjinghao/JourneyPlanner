# JourneyPlanner

A Journey Planner Application for Singapore:

Recommend the most efficient or effective travel options for user's travel and display the estimated travel time. Travel options include MRT and Buses. In the event of a service breakdown, the app will filter out station(s) which is/are unavailable and compute the most efficient route.

Launch the Journey Planner Application by running main.py

For the maintenance aspect of this application, we have included an Add Station App to facilitate the addition of mrt stations, bus services and/or other form of travel options. More stations can be added subsequently with ease by simply using the Add Station App.

Launch the Add Station Application by running addStation.py
